To address the lack of disaster evacuation training in remote education environments, we developed Disaster Escape, a game designed to teach elementary school students the proper response procedures in emergency situations such as fires, earthquakes, and CPR. Built using Python’s Pygame, the game features engaging characters, sound effects, and an easy-to-repeat structure to support continuous learning.

Key Features:

- Diverse Disaster Scenarios: Provides training on step-by-step evacuation procedures for scenarios like fires, earthquakes, and CPR.
- Character Selection: Allows users to choose their characters, enhancing engagement and enjoyment.
- Customized Problem-Solving: Uses multiple-choice quizzes tailored to each disaster scenario, encouraging players to learn correct responses.
- Additional Resources: Includes QR code links to the National Disaster Safety Portal for further study on a wider range of disaster responses.

Through this game, players can naturally learn appropriate actions for various scenarios and enhance their emergency response skills.
